# Vba_Challenge

  ## Background:
    * In this challenge, utilized the Stock Data file to analyze the stocks and output the following : 
    * * The ticker symbol.
    * * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
    * * The total stock volume of the stock. The vba script will showcase the ticker,yearly change, percent change and stock volume 

 ## Technologies used:
    * Microsoft Excel
    * Microsoft Excel Macros
    * VBA Script
 
  ## Steps, taken :
    * Create a new module in Excel VBA. So, we first add the necessary variables and headers to the worksheet
    * Next, a for loop was created to build the ticker (if statements are included)
    * Later on the percent change, yearly change formulas are used to figure out the stock fluctuations between the beginning and the end of the year.
    * The screenshots in the images folder, show results from the year 2014, 2015 and 2016.
    * Lastly, the excel vba sheet file size was reduced, due to file size issues. Repeat the steps for Year 2015 and Year 2016 sheets.
