# Vba_Challenge
 ## Main Objectives:
  * * In this challenge, utilized the Stock Data file to analyze the stocks and output the following : 
  * * The ticker symbol.
  * * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * * The total stock volume of the stock. The vba script will showcase the ticker,yearly change, percent change and stock volume 

# Steps, taken :
* Create a new module in Excel VBA. So, we first add the necessary variables and headers to the worksheet
* Next, a for loop was created to build the ticker (if statements are included)
* Later on the percent change, yearly change formulas are used to figure out the stock fluctuations between the beginning and the end of the year.
* -the screenshot shows the year 2014's , 2015's and 2016's stock data
* -Lastly, the excel vba sheet file size was reduced, due to file size issues. Repeat the steps for Year 2015 and Year 2016 sheets.
