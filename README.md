# Vba_Challenge

The vba script will showcase the ticker,yearly change, percent change and stock volume 

#Create a new module in Excel VBA
*So, we first add the headers to the worksheet
*Then the necessary variables were added
*Next, a for loop was created to build the ticker (if statements are included)
*Later on the percent change, yearly change formulas are used to figure out the stock fluctuations between the beginning and the end of the year.
*Conditional formatting is used to try to highlight the positive and negative changes to the yearly change column. The green represents positive changes.
*-the screenshot shows the year 2014's stock data
*-Lastly, the excel vba sheet file size was reduced, due to file size issues.
#Now repeat the steps for Year 2015 and Year 2015 sheets
